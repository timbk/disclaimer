## About

A dokuwiki render plugin that renders a user defined info message to the top of pages in user defined namespaces.

## Security

The info box text is directly used from the config value. You can put arbitrary HTML there. As this field is only editable by admins this should not be a real issue and more of a feature.
Use at your own risk, I give no guarantees for anything. Enjoy!
